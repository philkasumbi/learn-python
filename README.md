# learn-python
i just started learning python,i am very excited to start this journey, soo to start,
i did calculator mini app,
learned expressions and operations,
learned decision making conditions i.e if else match case and nested conditions,
created a movie ticket checker using the decision making conditions, i learned loops i.e while loops and for loops, i learned break and continue in loops,i created a guess number game,learned about functions, lambda functions and return statements in python and did some related beginner tasks,learned dictionaries and key values, learned lists in python, learned how to write clean code using modulars and utilities,created a CLI To-Do List App in Python (No Classes, No Filesâ€”Just Functions & Lists!), learned tuples and sets, created a simple students records mini project,i learned how to handle errors using the try except method, learned debugging, tracebacks, PEP8,
took some break anad now im back 
learned how to read and write `.txt`, `.csv`, and `.json` files in Python.

I learned how to create classes and objects in Python, including:

- Defining classes and methods  
- Using constructors (`__init__`) and magic methods (`__str__`)  
- Creating objects and calling their methods  
- Basic inheritance to reuse code

Examples include `Car`, `Dog`, `Book`, and `Animal` classes.

task;
I created a Student class that can:

Store a student's name and age

Keep track of their grades

Calculate their average grade

Print a clean summary using a special method--(student record mini app file)


did some exercise task on OOP, i.e simulation of bank operations, inheritance task 


I did webscrapping for the first time,
this shows scrapping the books.scrape.com website where you get to scrape the title,price,availability and rating of the book and then i stored the result in a csv file -(scrapping2 file)


Turns out, there are 50 pages of books on that site... and I wasnâ€™t going to copy-paste my code 50 times ðŸ˜…. So, I learned about pagination and how to make my scraper automatically go through all the pages.-(pagination scrapping file)


I did webscrapping for the second time,
this shows scrapping the quotes.toscrape.com website where you get to scrape the quote,author and tags of the book and then i stored the result in a csv file -(webscrapping task2 file)


This commit introduces a simple Python-based personal assistant that interacts through the terminal. Key features include:
- Greets user by name and remembers it between sessions (stored in `username.txt`)
- Tells the current time and date using the `datetime` module
- Evaluates basic math expressions via `eval()`
- Stores and recalls personalized information (e.g., "remember my favorite color is blue")
- Persists memory in a JSON file (`memory.txt`)
- Logs all user interactions in a `chat_log.txt` file
- Gracefully ends the session on 'bye' command

This script is a beginner-friendly project for learning Python file I/O, string handling, and simple conversational flow.(agent2 file)


This project showcases the core concepts of singly linked lists in Python. It includes two key operations: traversing a linked list from head to tail, and reversing the list to change the order of its elements. The code is clean, beginner-friendly, and a helpful resource for understanding how pointers work in dynamic data structures.(linked list folder)
